- **HolidayFlag**: Indicates whether there was a holiday at this time, with 1 indicating yes and 0 for no
- **DayofWeek**: Day of the week
- **WeekofYear**: Week of the year
- **PeriodofDay**: Indicates half hour period of a day
- **ForecastWindProduction**: The forecasted wind production at this specific time
- **SystemLoadEA**: The national load forecast at this specific time
- **SMPEA**: The price forecast at this specific time
- **ORKTemperature**: The temperature recorded at Cork Airport at this specific time
- **ORKWindspeed**: The windspeed recorded at Cork Airport at this specific time
- **CO2Intensity**: The amount of CO2 emitted for every kilowatt-hour of electricity generated (g/kWh)
- **ActualWindProduction**: The actual wind production at this specific time
- **SystemLoadEP2**: The actual national load forecast at this specific time
- **SMPEP2**: The actual price at this specific time
